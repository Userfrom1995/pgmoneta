/**
 * A block reference table is used to keep track of which blocks have been modified by WAL records within a
 * certain LSN range.
 *
 * For every relation fork, we track all the blocks that have been mentioned in the WAL
 * (Write-Ahead Logging). Along with that, we also record a "limit block," which represents the smallest
 * size (in blocks) that the relation has had during that range of WAL records. This limit block should
 * be set to 0 if the relation fork was either created or deleted, or to the new size after a truncation
 * has occurred.
 *
 * We have to store the blocks that have been modified for each relation file, to make it a bit efficient
 * we have two different representations of each block table entry.
 *
 * Firstly we will divide the relation into chunks of 2^16 blocks and choose between an array representation
 * if the number of modified block in a chunk are less and a bitmap representtaion if nearly all the blocks are modified
 *
 * In array representation, we don't need to store the entire block number instead we store each block number as a 2-byte
 * offset from the start of the chunk.
 *
 * These same basic representational choices are used both when a block reference table is stored in memory
 * and when it is serialized to disk.
